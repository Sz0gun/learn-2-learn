### **Bot Integration with GitHub Actions**

## **Overview**

Integrating a Telegram bot with GitHub Actions allows for dynamic and secure management of sensitive data during the CI/CD process. The bot communicates with a HashiCorp Vault to retrieve secrets and interacts with GitHub Actions either by:
1. **Providing secrets dynamically** during the execution of a pipeline.
2. **Triggering pipelines** based on predefined conditions or user commands.

---

## **Use Cases**

1. **Dynamic Secrets Management**
   - GitHub Actions retrieves secrets on demand via the bot.
   - Secrets are **not stored** in the GitHub repository, reducing security risks.

2. **Pipeline Triggering**
   - The bot listens for commands to trigger specific pipelines.
   - Example: Deploying to production only upon approval from an authorized user.

3. **Monitoring and Notifications**
   - The bot monitors pipeline status and sends updates to a designated Telegram chat.

#### **Bot Requirements**
- The bot requires access to:
  - Telegram API (API ID, API Hash, and Bot Token).
  - Vault API (Vault address and token).
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install pyrogram python-dotenv hvac requests
  ```

#### **Bot Configuration**
- Environment variables:
  - `TELEGRAM_API_ID`: Your Telegram API ID.
  - `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`: Your Telegram API Hash.
  - `VAULT_ADDR`: Vault URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8200`).
  - `VAULT_TOKEN`: Vault token for authentication.

- Sample `.env` file:
  ```env
  TELEGRAM_API_ID=123456
  TELEGRAM_API_HASH=abcdef1234567890
  VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
  VAULT_TOKEN=my_vault_token
  ```

### **2. GitHub Actions Workflow**

#### **Action to Request Secrets**
- Add a `request-secrets` job to GitHub Actions workflow:
  ```yaml
  name: CI/CD Pipeline with Telegram Bot

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    request-secrets:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Send request to Telegram Bot
          run: |
            curl -X POST \
              -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
              -d '{"chat_id": "YOUR_CHAT_ID", "text": "/get_secret django/database"}' \
              https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/sendMessage
    ```

### **Bot â†” GitHub Communication**

#### **Authentication**
- To ensure secure communication:
  - **Signed requests** with a pre-shared key.
  - TLS for all API requests.

#### **Dynamic Variables in GitHub**
- Secrets fetched by the bot can be stored temporarily in GitHub workflow environment variables:
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Export secret as environment variable
      run: |
        export DATABASE_URL=$(curl -s https://example.com/get-secret)
      env:
        VAULT_ADDR: ${{ secrets.VAULT_ADDR }}
        VAULT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}
    ```

---

## **Benefits**

1. **Enhanced Security:**
   - Secrets are managed centrally in Vault and accessed dynamically, minimizing exposure.
2. **Cost-Effective:**
   - Reduces dependency on additional secret management plugins for GitHub Actions.
3. **Real-Time Monitoring:**
   - Telegram notifications keep stakeholders updated instantly.

---

## **Challenges**

1. **Authentication Between Bot and Actions**
   - Use signed requests and validate origin.
2. **Latency in Secret Retrieval**
   - Use caching mechanisms like Redis for frequently accessed secrets.
3. **Failover**
   - Deploy redundant bots to handle requests in case of failures.
