# Secrets Roadmap
![alt text](<secrets roadmap.png>)
## **Overview**
This document provides a detailed breakdown of the data flow, encryption methods, and potential areas for improvement in the current secrets management system. The workflow prioritizes the use of gRPC for secure and asynchronous communication between components, eliminating HTTP/HTTPS wherever possible.

---

## **Data Flow Description**
1. **Step 1: API Call (Request Secret)**  
   - **Initiator:** UserBot  
   - **Target:** HashiCorp Vault  
   - **Data Type:** Request for a specific secret (e.g., database credentials or API keys).  
   - **Communication Protocol:** gRPC ensures low-latency and secure communication.  

2. **Step 2: Store Temporary Secret in Redis**  
   - **Initiator:** Vault  
   - **Target:** Redis  
   - **Data Type:** Encrypted secret with a defined TTL (Time-to-Live).  
   - **Encryption:** Secrets are hashed (SHA256) before storage. Redis communication is secured via TLS or an encrypted gRPC-based proxy.  

3. **Step 3: Store Data in IPFS**  
   - **Initiator:** Vault  
   - **Target:** IPFS Gateway  
   - **Data Type:** Secure data payload (e.g., configuration files, larger keys).  
   - **Communication Protocol:** Replace HTTP-based interactions with gRPC/IPFS native APIs.  
   - **Encryption:** Data is encrypted using AES-256 before upload.  

4. **Step 4: Return Encrypted Data + CID to UserBot**  
   - **Initiator:** Vault  
   - **Target:** UserBot  
   - **Data Type:** Encrypted secret and CID for IPFS data.  
   - **Communication Protocol:** gRPC provides encrypted communication.  

5. **Step 5: Send Data to Django/FastAPI**  
   - **Initiator:** UserBot  
   - **Target:** Django/FastAPI backend  
   - **Data Type:** CID and temporary secrets retrieved from Vault and Redis.  
   - **Communication Protocol:** WebSocket (with gRPC as a potential alternative).  

6. **Step 6: Retrieve Temporary Secret from Redis**  
   - **Initiator:** Django/FastAPI  
   - **Target:** Redis  
   - **Data Type:** Encrypted secret.  
   - **Communication Protocol:** TLS or gRPC-based communication.  

7. **Step 7: Retrieve Content by CID**  
   - **Initiator:** Django/FastAPI  
   - **Target:** IPFS Gateway  
   - **Data Type:** Encrypted content stored in IPFS.  
   - **Communication Protocol:** IPFS gRPC/native APIs for data retrieval.  

8. **Step 8: Final Response to UserBot**  
   - **Initiator:** Django/FastAPI  
   - **Target:** UserBot  
   - **Data Type:** Processed response based on the retrieved secrets or content.  
   - **Communication Protocol:** gRPC for end-to-end encrypted communication.

## **Hashing and Encryption**
### **Hashing**
- **SHA256**: Used for hashing sensitive data before storage in Redis or during transmission.
- **Purpose:** Ensures data integrity and prevents tampering.

### **Encryption**
- **AES-256:** Applied to data stored in IPFS for high-level security.
- **gRPC Encryption:** Built-in secure communication with TLS encryption.

---

## **Asynchronous Technologies**
- **Python `asyncio`:** Enables non-blocking calls between components.  
- **gRPC Streams:** Facilitates low-latency, real-time bidirectional communication.  
- **Redis Pub/Sub:** Provides efficient and asynchronous messaging between components.

---

## **Potential Weaknesses and Improvement Tasks**
1. **Vault Single Point of Failure**  
   - **Weakness:** If Vault is unavailable, the entire secrets workflow is disrupted.  
   - **Solution:** Deploy a replicated Vault setup or enable high-availability mode.

2. **Redis Expiration**  
   - **Weakness:** Secrets stored in Redis may expire before being used.  
   - **Solution:** Implement better TTL management or periodic refresh logic.

3. **gRPC Migration Challenges**  
   - **Weakness:** Replacing HTTP/HTTPS requires updates to all components to support gRPC.  
   - **Solution:** Phase out HTTP gradually and test gRPC endpoints extensively.

4. **IPFS Gateway Performance**  
   - **Weakness:** Delays in retrieving data from IPFS could slow down the backend.  
   - **Solution:** Use a local IPFS node or a caching layer.

5. **Key Rotation**  
   - **Weakness:** Lack of automated key rotation mechanisms for AES-256 encryption.  
   - **Solution:** Integrate Vault's dynamic secrets feature for automatic key rotation.

## **Roadmap for Future Enhancements**
1. **Full Transition to gRPC:** Replace all HTTP-based communications with gRPC for better performance and security.  
2. **Integrate with Web3 Technologies:** Explore direct integration with blockchain for distributed and immutable secrets management.  
3. **Enhance Monitoring:** Implement Prometheus and Grafana to monitor secrets usage and detect anomalies.  
4. **Adopt Zero Trust Architecture:** Enforce stricter identity verification and access controls between components.  
5. **AI-Powered Security Analysis:** Leverage AI tools to analyze and detect vulnerabilities in the secrets workflow.

This updated roadmap ensures we align with the project's goal of eliminating HTTP/HTTPS and leveraging the advantages of gRPC for secure, efficient communication.
