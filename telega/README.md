## **Userbot integration with HashiCorp Vault**

### **Main assumptions**

- Userbot will act as an intermediary between the application and Vault.
- Keys and secrets will be stored in Vault and available upon request.
- Communication with Vault will be via API, and the userbot will sends requests in response to commands.
- Storing keys and secrets in encrypted form. Support for auto-unseal and dynamic key generation.
- Apply Kubernetes NetworkPolicy so that the pod can only communicate with selected resources.
- Apply dynamic tokens for the userbot, refreshed by Vault.
- Create ACL policies in Vault and Etcd to minimize access.

### **TODO**

**Automation**
Deploy Vault and configure userbot uses Ansible.
**Monitoring**
Userbot interaction with Vault.
**Extensions**
CRUD keys in Vault on demand.

### **Required tokens**

- *Vault* encrypt it in secure env

### **Vault â†” Etcd**
- Data encrypiton in-transit.
- Data encryption at-rest.

### **For consideration**
- Pyrogram MTProto Proxy
- Telethon p2p
- Inter-Process Communication (Unix Domain Sockets)
- Instead of using the HTTP API, use HashiCorp Vault SDK (data is transfred directly in aplication memory).
